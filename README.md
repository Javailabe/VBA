# VBA

## Description
This is collective repository of excel macros/procedures which helps by process automation.

## Repository structure
Main <- Test <- Develop

## How work with repository?
Few rules should be kept during developing this project:
1. Assumption is to keep each macro/procedure in separate folder inside VBA repository
2. Whenever new procedure will be created, new issue (created as separate branch, Testing) should be initiated on GitHub and another branch for Develope
3. Macro/procedure folder should include readme file with short description how it works
